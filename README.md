Author: Barbara G. Shwom; Lisa Gueldenzoph Snyder; Liz Clarke

As the world shifts to a greater reliance on digital media, it is appropriate that this text evolves as well. This second edition is the first fully digital version of Business Communication: Polishing Your Professional Presence. Instructors and students will find that, although the medium has changed, the content is fully consistent with the prior edition.

This ISBN is for the Pearson eText and may not include any media, website access codes, or print supplement.

The skills needed for proficient and professional business communication have never been more important than they are now, in the early 2020s. At the time of this writing, the novel coronavirus has disrupted the Canadian, and indeed the global, workplace. Meetings are happening virtually. Professionals and even entry level hires are working from home. There is no reliable timeline on whether—or if—this “new normal” will change. How can students and instructors make sense of this complex communications environment?

This resource presents a detailed yet forward-thinking approach to technology, a deep exploration of one’s own communication styles and the styles of others, a respectful yet thought-provoking look at cross-cultural communication and diverse workplaces, and a pragmatic toolkit on collaboration. Business Communications: Polishing Your Professional Presence is the most dynamic, current, and engaging Canadian text in its category.
